This is a fitness blog project. It has been created in Blazor Server, Net Core 6 LTS. The idea was to create a web app where the blogger could write up posts, preview them, and then publish them without my assistance. This goal has been met and having gone through the process I have thought of so many ways I'd like to make it better in the future!

## Highlights

- Azure
- Custom Domain Name from Rebel
- CI deployment from GitHub
- Swear word filtering
- Pagination
- HTML5, CSS3, SASS
- SQL Server
- Email List
- Post Sharing 
- Optimized for mobile 
- Post Sorting 
- Role-based authorization for segregated actions
- Register new accounts (role = "regular user")
- Admin Controls, create, remove, delete posts and comments.
