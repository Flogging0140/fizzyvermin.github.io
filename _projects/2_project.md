Below I have included the video for some of the fun things I got to do with my Bad USBs üëæü§´

    Brute forcing my Anderoid phone as a proof of concept.

Apologies in advance, This one is hard to watch because of my lack of film equipment. The idea is clear through, I am demonstrating I can similarly give commands to a phone with either of these devices. In this example I am using it to wait 30 seconds (lockout period) then to enter passwords. Since on this phone the default is 30s wait and no wipe, and only having 4 digit # password it would take me about ~4 days to brute force. I did skip this part for time sake but can be done.

This took a lot of effort on my part and research. In summery there is one setting in windows you have to disable 1 time, could be done with a USB like the other examples. Once this is done I just created a powershell script that pulled some code hosted on my GitHub (could be anywhere), then schedule a task to run triggered by user login. Using someone elses library I can get access to their computer remotely as demonstrated by the remote attack computer (my Kali desktop). I will have the same permissions/access level the logged in user has. 


Since the PC basically thinks the user is typing this through a keyboard is is a great example of why giving a threat actor physical access to a device is a bad idea to say the least. 

My slides for this fun project can be found below. 

<b>Note: </b><i>These were proof of concept projects, everything was done on my hardware, I am not condoning or recommending this and neither was the assignment. In fact I did this responsibly with the freedom of topics I was given.</i>
