Below I have included the video for some of the fun things I got to do with my Bad USBs ðŸ‘¾ðŸ¤«

    Brute forcing my Anderoid phone as a proof of concept. 
</div>

Apologies in advance, This one is hard to watch because of my lack of film equipment. The idea is clear through, I am demonstrating I can similarly give commands to a phone with either of these devices. In this example I am using it to wait 30 seconds (lockout period) then to enter passwords. Since on this phone the default is 30s wait and no wipe, and only having 4 digit # password it would take me about ~4 days to brute force. I did skip this part for time sake but can be done.

    My desktop is the attack comptuer, using my Kali usb. My laptop is the subject of attack. I create scheduled PS task triggered on login that if listening the attack comptuer can get access. 
</div>

This took a lot of effort on my part and research. In summery there is one setting in windows you have to disable 1 time, could be done with a USB like the other examples. Once this is done I just created a powershell script that pulled some code hosted on my GitHub (could be anywhere), then schedule a task to run triggered by user login. Using someone elses library I can get access to their computer remotely as demonstrated by the remote attack computer (my Kali desktop). I will have the same permissions/access level the logged in user has. 


Since the PC basically thinks the user is typing this through a keyboard is is a great example of why giving a threat actor physical access to a device is a bad idea to say the least.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.
