AHHHHHH

#### Current Projects List ðŸ‘€
<ul>
    <li>Reddit Video Creator</li>
    <li>Radio Remote Trigger</li>
    <li>Blazor Client Converter</li>
    <li>Features on Fitness Blog</li>
    <li>Centralizing codebase (public)</li>
    <li>Tally app</li>
    <li>Organizing your digital life (YT short playlist)</li>
    
</ul>

Ok so this is a lot. Especially since these are just projects. I plan to just finish these and be very carful of what I take on in the future from myself. Because I need to focus on 1 personal project at a time to do it well.
