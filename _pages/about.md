This is just a bit about me, what I do and like doing 🧐.

#### What I am doing:

Currently am working at my internship, going ~1yr. 

#### What I do:

I program for work 💻 and personal projects. When not doing this I am reading or at the gym. I may try other things next summer like golf 💭.

#### Music, Movies:

Little bits about me. My absolute favorite LOFI 🎵 artist is <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/73aKnLT4O8G2pBEfdlQzrE?si=xYgIXkTSQGGEYd6KbhMFCg" target="_blank">Purple Cat</a>. Seriously just listen to this album <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/7A5vVrxjCelpOMceajwqJ2?si=wkWQab_STDGcSuieH21xUg" target="_blank">Sea Of Stars 2</a> 🥺.

For movies I think <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093779/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk" target="_blank">The Princess Bride</a> 👑 comes in first and second: <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106697/" target="_blank">Demolition Man</a> 🧨. And you know cartoons is something I have loved since a kid and still do. Gravity falls, Family Guy, the Simpsons, American Dad, Inside Job, Cowboy Bebop, Bojack Horseman, Disenchantment, Midnight Gospel, Rick and Morty, Spongebob (yes really). I will also say I do watch 'some' anime. Death Note, Spriggan, My Hero Academia, Odd Taxi, Soul Eater, One Piece, Mob Psycho 100, Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away, etc. 

#### Habits:

I am a creature of routine. I have a plan for the day and goals for what I want to accomplish. Goals evolve as I figure out what can get done in a day. The gym is a great part of my routine. For stress reduction and relaxation I find it to be of great use.

#### Poems:

I should note; very important. Have you read <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/robert-frost" target="_blank">Robert Frost</a>? He is my favorite poet, 🥶. A great read is <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44272/the-road-not-taken" target="_blank">The Road Not Taken</a>.

#### High School 🏫: 

So then... I attended high school in Vanguard. Got out an semester early. After realizing I had spent a significant bout of time as a child on computers and messing around with stuff I decided to go to college. I want to mention I was not making amazing programs and stuff since a kid. I really just was solving problems, figuring out sandbox video game cheats, and messing around with Linux as cybersecurity was of interest. After reading about it I did realize privacy online is really a myth. Having said this, it does not really bother me; I am a huge fan of convenience from technology if used properly. 

#### College 🎓:

Anyway I what was I talking about, ah yes, attending college. I went to Medicine Hat College, which started off in person but switched to online and then back to in person because of the 'world situation' at the time. I liked it though, learning about problem solving and configuring software. I did also enjoy writing my own programs as well. The only con I would say about writing programs is I have so many I want to write (I have a list on my phone) that I am pretty sure I would not be able to complete all of them in a decade. I have to focus on one at a time. I was able to create some great ones during college and learn a lot more about software development as it was my major. 

#### RN 😎:

Now having graduated I have been working as an intern which is great. I am really liking it, only thing I'd change is working from somewhere warmer.
This brings us up till now ig...
