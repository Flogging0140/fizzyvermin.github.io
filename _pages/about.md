This is just a bit about me, what I do and like doing üßê.

#### What I am doing:

I am currently working as a Backend Developer and SEM Analyst. I work in the AspNet Framework.

I program for work üíª and personal projects. When not doing this I am reading or at the gym. Coming up soon is school. Having completed my diploma in IT and Internet Software I am starting University for CS. 

I am a creature of routine. I have a plan for the day and goals for what I want to accomplish. Goals evolve as I figure out what can get done in a day.

* Check out the nav bar for projects I am currently working on. 
* See the blog section for random thoughts.
