So warning I will start off kinda professional and boring but this will turn into moore of a rant as this goes on. 

I like working remotely, ah nvm were going random rant. 

First off, a little bit about me. My absolute favorite LOFI artist is <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/73aKnLT4O8G2pBEfdlQzrE?si=xYgIXkTSQGGEYd6KbhMFCg" target="_blank">Purple Cat</a>. Seriously just listen to this album <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/7A5vVrxjCelpOMceajwqJ2?si=wkWQab_STDGcSuieH21xUg" target="_blank">Sea Of Stars 2</a>; it hits hard. 



For movies I think obvioulsy <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093779/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk" target="_blank">The Princess Bride</a> comes in first and second probs: <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106697/" target="_blank">Demolition Man</a>. I will say some proper anime is also good for watching.
