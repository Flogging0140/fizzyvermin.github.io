This is just a bit about me, what I do and like doing 🧐.

### About Me  

I’m a curious participant in the game of life, driven by a love for technology and learning. 🧐  

I code for personal projects, read voraciously, and find balance at the gym. Routine is my superpower; I map out my days with clear goals that adapt as I learn what’s possible to achieve.
