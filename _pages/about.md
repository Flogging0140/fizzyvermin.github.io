This is just a bit about me, what I do and like doing 🧐.

#### What I am doing:

Currently am working at my internship, going ~1yr.

I program for work 💻 and personal projects. When not doing this I am reading or at the gym. I may try other things in the summer, like golf 💭.


I am a creature of routine. I have a plan for the day and goals for what I want to accomplish. Goals evolve as I figure out what can get done in a day.

#### Notes:

* Checkout the nav bar for projects I am currently working on. 
* The my blog section is just random thoughts.
