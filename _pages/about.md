So warning I will start off kinda professional and boring but this will turn into moore of a rant as this goes on. 

<i>
  This is a work in progress as a whole, I just setup this weekend and have been modifying stuff so not really complete. 
</i>

I like working remotely, ah nvm were going random rant. 

First off, a little bit about me. My absolute favorite LOFI artist is <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/73aKnLT4O8G2pBEfdlQzrE?si=xYgIXkTSQGGEYd6KbhMFCg" target="_blank">Purple Cat</a>. Seriously just listen to this album <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/7A5vVrxjCelpOMceajwqJ2?si=wkWQab_STDGcSuieH21xUg" target="_blank">Sea Of Stars 2</a>; it hits hard. 

For movies I think obvioulsy <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093779/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk" target="_blank">The Princess Bride</a> comes in first and second probs: <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106697/" target="_blank">Demolition Man</a>. I will say some proper anime is also good for watching. 

I am a creature of routine. I have a plan for the day and goals for what I want to acomplish. This is interesting as the goals evolve when I figure out what I can get done in a day and what is to much. The gym is a great part of my routine. For stress reduction and relaxation I find it to be of great use. Later on I may add my gym insta, idk. 

I should note; very importiant. Have you read <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/robert-frost" target="_blank">Robert Frost</a>? He is my favorite poet, I think ðŸ¤”. A great read is <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44272/the-road-not-taken" target="_blank">The Road Not Taken</a>.

So then, I attended high school in Vanguard. Cool experience. Got out an semester early to process information and watch anime, this was during Covid ðŸ˜– BTW. After relizing I have spent a large chunk of my free time since a child on computers and messing around with stuff I decided to go to college. I should mention I was not making amazing programs and stuff since a kid. I really just was solving problems, figuring out sandbox video game cheats, and messing around with Linux as cybersecurity was of interest. After reading about it I did realize privacy online is really a myth which. Having said this it does not really bother me; I am a huge fan of the convenience of technology if used properly. 

Anyway I what was I talking about, ah yes, attending college. I went to Medicine Hat College, which started off in person but switched to online and then back to in person because of the 'situation' at the time. I liked it though, learning about problem solving and configuring softare was great. I did also enjoy writing my own programs as well. The only con I would say about writing programs is I have so many I want to write (I have a list on my phone) that I am pretty sure I would not be able to complete all of them in a decade. I have to focus on one at a time but I was able to create some great ones during college and learn a lot more about software developement as it was my major. 

Now having graduated I have been working as an intern which is great. 
I will update this page later, it is dark out and I want to go to bed...
