So far I have been working out for a long time. Started back in 2018 I think... 
Started in a abandon high school gym, I think. I will have to ask, I was ~150lbs around that time ðŸ¤”

<br />

## Starting Out


<div class="container center">  
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-6">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/Fitness/toned-2020-160lbs2.jpg" title="" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
      </div>    
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>
          Throughout college I continued. Medicine Hat offered the 'leisure center' && later we got a remodeled gym at the college.
          Here I am about ~155lbs, decently toned; it is ~2020. 
        </p>
        {% include video.html 
          path="assets/video/Fitness/collegeCollage1.mp4" 
          title="Tough Going" 
          class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" 
          caption="These were not easy. My form needs to be better, getting there."
          controls=true autoplay=false%}
      </div>   
    </div>
</div>

## Getting Better / 5am


<div class="container">  
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
      {% include figure.html path="assets/img/fitness/BC2-Collage.jpg" title="Different Part of BC" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>    
    <div class="col-md-6">
      <p>
        I had started getting up at 5am around late 2020 I would say. The past couple years it has just been more consistant. 
      </p>
      <h4> I've been getting serious. </h4>
      <p>          
        After staying with a friend in BC we got up at 5am to workout. Every week day for ~1 month. 
        It has been 3ish months since and I continue, as does he. 
      </p>
    </div>

## Serious Means Commitment


<div class="card">  
  <div class="card-item">
    {% include figure.html path="assets/img/fitness/walking-winter1.jpg" title="My Week Day Walk" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
      <p>
        This is me, it's my daily walk. I think it was -25C that day, so not too cold.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>I have nothing else to say that one can not infer from this picture.</i>
      </p>
  </div>

        title="Push-Up Handstand"
        caption="Still somethign I am working on. Progress continues. This has been more difficult since bulking."

## An Active Job


<div class="container">  
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-6">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/Fitness/2022-gettingBetter.jpg" title="2022 - Zipline Guide" class="img-fluid w-75 rounded z-depth-1" %}        
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>
          Having an active job this was my phisique. It was easier to maintain taking morning runs and working in the ourdoors. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Though I am no longer a zipline guide it was fun.

## Putting on Good Weight

<div class="container"> 
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
      {% include figure.html path="assets/img/fitness/2024-dorito.jpg" title="" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>    
    <div class="col-md-6">
      <p>
        In summer the cold is gone and I have been able to get back to going to the gym first thing in the morning.        
      </p>
      <p>
        In the winter months the afternoon has been better. It takes about 15min to warm up the car in -30 sk weather, 15min drive, 5min warm up after gym, and a 15min drive back. 
      </p>
      <p>
        At this point it's early 2024. I am about 165lbs.
